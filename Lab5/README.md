## Introduction
This lab assignment focuses on creating two HTML pages (`index.html` and `videoPage.html`) along with a CSS file (`styles.css`) to implement the functionalities and styling as per the instructions provided.

## Instructions
The following files are included in the submission:
- `index.html`: Implements a login page with a "Remember Me" checkbox.
- `videoPage.html`: Displays a movie trailer, recommended movies, and movie descriptions.
- `styles.css`: Provides styles for both pages.

## Files Structure
```
2024201029.zip
|_____ 2024201029/
      |_____ index.html
      |_____ videoPage.html
      |_____ styles.css
      |_____ README.md
```

## Execution Steps
1. Extract the contents of the `2024201029.zip` file.
2. Open `index.html` in a browser to view the login page.
3. Use the "Login" button to navigate to the `videoPage.html` which contains the movie trailer, table of recommended movies, and additional content.
4. Use the "Logout" button on `videoPage.html` to navigate back to the `index.html` page.

### Notes
- Ensure that `styles.css` is in the same directory as `index.html` and `videoPage.html` for the styling to be applied correctly.

## Assumptions
Both HTML files are using the same CS file.

### Question 1

### Question 2

## Additional Information
- **Mandatory Fields**: All input fields in the forms are set to `required` to ensure that users cannot submit empty data.
- **CSS Styling**: The styling uses `media-queries` for responsiveness, hover effects for buttons and input fields, and transitions for dynamic elements.
- **No External Dependencies**: The pages are self-contained and do not require external libraries or tools for execution.
